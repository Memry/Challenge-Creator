# Challenge-Creator
Greetings, Aspiring Comrades and other coders!  

I have several recurring challenges, some for guilds, some personal.  Many of these challenges are identical each week/month except for the dates. Some have different tasks each month, but the challenge recurs next year with the same tasks but new dates.  What I want (and briefly had until a few changes were made in Habitica's code last year) is a tool that will take data from a text file and create the challenge.  I keep the challenge data in a spreadsheet (excel style, but actually WPS) and can export or copy to text.  

So here is the challenge:

Create a tool that will work from a webpage.
The tool will take either a csv or text file (you can choose either or both, I am adaptable) and put it into Habitica as a challenge. 

My preference is that the file can be uploaded to the website. 

Language preference:  I honestly do not care. I want the tool to be efficient, not a cumbersome awkward thing.  You know better than I do what languages are most effective for this purpose, or what language you work best in.  You may need to know that I use a PC at home, so that is the format I will use in creating text or csv files. Ideally, though, this tool would be available to anyone who creates recurring challenges like me.  I will be happy to share the wps spreadsheet I use to store my challenge data with anyone who wants to use it.

The information in the file is in the following order:

Challenge Name

Short Name

Summary

Challenge Description

Guild ID

Categories

Gem Prize

Indicator for beginning of tasks

//Tasks are listed in this way:

Task Type: Habit; Title; Notes; Difficulty; Start Date

Task Type: Daily; Title; Notes; Difficulty; Start Date; Repeats; Repeats Every; Repeat On

Task Type: To Do; Title; Notes; Difficulty; Due Date

Task Type: Reward; Title; Notes; Cost

1 Task per line

Indicator for end of tasks

NOTE:  I have a sample of a text file and a csv file.  As I said, either or both could be used.  The information kept in the file can be adapted if it would streamline the program.  For instance, for daily tasks, I have used SMTWHFA for the days of the week.  If a different format would be best for them, I can do that.  I could even use a single bit to indicate weekdays, where 1 (only the first bit on, counting from the low end, of course) = Sunday only, 2 (only the second bit on) = Monday only, 3 (first and second bit on) = Sunday and Monday, and so forth. 

Essentially, if I can create a spreadsheet formula to calculate the output needed in the file, I can use it and I will be happy to update my file to make this as streamlined as possible.  That includes incorporating appropriate id for any of the task info.

I am offering 100 gems for this tool.  If you choose to work as a team, you can do so, and you can either claim the entire prize and divide it yourself or ask me to divide it for you.  

Again, I am open to a great deal of adaptation to make this work.  The main thing is that I will have something that works for me.  Please feel free to communicate with me and suggest changes to my data file.
